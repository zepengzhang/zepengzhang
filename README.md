- ðŸ”­ Previously, I have also designed some nonconvex optimization algorithms for solving rate maximization problems in communication and portfolio design problems in finance.
- âš¡ I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hyBOSa0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Outside of that, I love traveling and exploring different things. Currently, I also spend some time cooking, reading, meditating, running, precticing guitar, and learning French.
