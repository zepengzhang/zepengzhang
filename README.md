- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a PhD student at EPFL, Switzerland.
- ðŸ”­ My current research focuses on neural algorithm reasoning and graph machine learning with industrial applications. If you are interested in this area, [here](https://github.com/zepengzhang/awesome-neural-algorithmic-reasoning) is a collection of papers in neural algorithmic reasoning!
- ðŸ˜„ Before coming to Switzerland, I was fortunate to spend a nice time at WHU, CityU, ShanghaiTech, and PKU.
- ðŸ”­ Previously, I have also designed some nonconvex optimization algorithms for solving rate maximization problems in communication and portfolio design problems in finance.
- âš¡ I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hyBOSa0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Outside of that, I love traveling and exploring different things. Recently, I also spend some time cooking, reading, meditating, hiking, running, and practicing guitar.
